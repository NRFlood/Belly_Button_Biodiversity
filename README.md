# Belly-Button-Biodiversity

## Overview of Belly Button data - Working with Plotly

The purpose of this project was to help Roza complete her dashboard that would highlight the demographic information and provide visuals for the bacterial data that is found in each volunteer’s navel. Using Plotly and JavaScript we were able to write code that identifies the top 10 bacterial species in each volunteer’s belly button and illustrates the results in an easy-to-read bar chart.  We also created a gauge chart that shows how often each subject washes their belly button each week, as well as a bubble chart that highlights the bacteria cultures per sample. With this data Roza will be able to quickly identify volunteers whose belly button bacteria match any species that Improbable Beef determines to be a candidate for manufacturing synthetic beef.

To customize the dashboard a bit more we leveraged HTML and Bootstrap to add an image to the Jumbotron, change the background color, and italicized the font on the page.  This will hopefully help make Roza's dashboard more visually appealing to those that use it.
